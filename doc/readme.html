<p>====================================================================<br />
  INTRODUCTION <br />
  ====================================================================</p>
<p>This program is designed to simplify the use of texure packs. It allows you to install parts of a texture pack</p>
<p>For example, if you had a global texture pack, but only liked the imperial textures, this would allow you <br>
to only install those textures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>====================================================================<br />
  KNOWN LIMITATIONS<br />
  ====================================================================</p>
<p>It eats harddrive space. There is no compression of stored mods.</p>
<p>There is no way to configure the directories other than chaning the source file (~Line 37) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>====================================================================<br />
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />
  ====================================================================</p>
<p>Install Python and wxPython. This was built on version 2.5, I don't know how it runs, nor do I support<br>
  other version of Python
</p>
<p>Unzip the mod to your Morrowind Directory. <strong>Not</strong> the data files directory.</p>
<p>You should now have a directory called &quot;Texture Manager&quot; in your Data Files directory </p>
<p>Run either  texture_manager.py (program with a console) or texture_manager_nc.pyw (program without a<br>
console)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  USING THE SOFTWARE<br />
  ====================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Installing A Mod</strong>:<br>
Install the mod exactly as you would, but put the mod in <em>Texture Manager\Install</em> rather than <em>Data Files<br>
</em>Open Texture Manager, and type in the name of the mod into the box next to the install button<br>
  Press Install<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot have two mods installed with the same name </p>

<ol>
  <li>The textbox that specifies the name when you are installing a mod</li>
  <li>The list of mods</li>
  <li>The list of files contained by the mod</li>
  <li>Select a mod, and press this to remove the mod. (From the data files as well)(Note: You may have to press Apply Change before you can use this button). </li>
  <li>Select this to install the mods in the order you selected</li>
  <li>This is the list of arcitecture types</li>
  <li>When a arcitecture type is selected, you can reorder it in here</li>
  <li>This box contains the disabled mods for the arcitecture type    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changing the Archtecture file:</strong><br> 
  The program works out what arcitecture a file comes from using the regex file <em>TM_Data\Data\Regex.ini<br>
  </em>Feel free to edit this, and even better send me the changes. </p>
